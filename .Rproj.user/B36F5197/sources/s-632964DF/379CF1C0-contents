I am a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at [Vanderbilt University's Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/).  My research centers on American political institutions, with a focus on the presidency, organized interests, and legislative politics, and addresses substantive issues including representation and inequality in political voice.  My work applies quantitative approaches to analyze both observational "big data" and original surveys and experiments conducted with elite and mass public samples.  I received my PhD in [Political Science from Washington University in St. Louis](https://polisci.wustl.edu/) in May 2020.
