I am an Assistant Professor of Government at [American University](https://www.american.edu/spa/gov/).  My research centers on American political institutions, with a focus on the presidency, organized interests, and legislative politics, and addresses substantive issues including representation and inequality in political voice.  My work applies quantitative approaches to analyze both observational "big data" and original surveys and experiments conducted with elite and mass public samples.  

My research has been published in academic journals such as *American Political Science Review*, *Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization*, *Journal of Public Policy*, *Legislative Studies Quarterly*, and *Presidential Studies Quarterly*, and my dissertation received the 2021 George C. Edwards III Dissertation Award for the best dissertation on executive politics completed and accepted in 2019 or 2020.

I am also a founding co-organizer of the [Junior Americanist Workshop Series (JAWS)](https://jawspolisci.network/), a virtual research seminar for early career American politics scholars created during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Previously, I served as an Assistant Professor of Political Science at [University of California, Riverside](https://politicalscience.ucr.edu/) (Fall 2023-Spring 2024) and [East Tennessee State University](https://www.etsu.edu/cas/polisci/) (Fall 2021-Spring 2023) and as a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at [Vanderbilt University's Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/) (Fall 2020-Spring 2021).  I received my PhD in [Political Science from Washington University in St. Louis](https://polisci.wustl.edu/) in May 2020.

Finally, I am a devoted Swiftie who has tweeted annual "Taylor Swift as American politics books" threads since 2020 ([2020](https://twitter.com/DrDRMiller/status/1293004228726751236?s=20), [2021](https://twitter.com/DrDRMiller/status/1424732716226985997?s=20), [2022](https://twitter.com/DrDRMiller/status/1582849110587355136?s=20), [2023](https://twitter.com/DrDRMiller/status/1685997864747425792?s=20), [2024](https://twitter.com/DrDRMiller/status/1823350789538005004), [2025](https://bsky.app/profile/davidryanmiller.com/post/3lzydxnumuk2f)) and whose [The Eras Tour "Some Kind of Congressman" costume was retweeted by Taylor Nation.](https://twitter.com/taylornation13/status/1649923424112852993?s=20)
